# CudaStonks
This project was developed for the Spring 2024 class of CS147 (GPU programming) at UCR.

It contains an hand written back propagating neural network for predicting stocks data, both a CPU-based implementation using plain python and numpy, and a GPU-based implementation using PyCuda.

There is also a PyTorch version for comparison.

## Setup
First of all clone the repository. 
<br>Once you are done, install the required python packages:
```
# You can setup a virtual environment if you want
python3 -m pip install venv
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install packages
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the code
Change directory to `src` and from there you can run the targets of the makefile.
- Run `make cpu` to run the cpu version of the neural network
- Run `make gpu` to run the gpu version of the neural network
- Run `make pytorch` to run the model on pytorch
